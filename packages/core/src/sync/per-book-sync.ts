/**
 * Per-book cloud sync engine (WebDAV / S3).
 *
 * Replaces the per-device full-snapshot layout for cloud backends. Remote
 * layout (all under the synced root, e.g. /readany/sync):
 *
 *   index.json                 — membership + change markers, one entry per
 *                                book / thread: { b: bookUpdatedAt, a: annotationsUpdatedAt,
 *                                d: deletedAt } / { t: threadUpdatedAt, d: deletedAt }.
 *                                Written read-merge-write by every device.
 *   books/{bookId}.json        — the book row plus ALL of its highlights,
 *                                notes and bookmarks, and a per-table
 *                                `deleted` map (id → deletedAt).
 *   threads/{threadId}.json    — thread row only (title/metadata).
 *   chat/{YYYY-MM-DD}.json     — every chat message CREATED that day, with a
 *                                `deleted` map. Devices keep a pulled-day
 *                                cursor and only fetch days past it, plus
 *                                days whose file changed under the cursor
 *                                (late-arriving offline messages).
 *   profile/{table}.json       — tags / book_tags / book_groups / skills,
 *                                one uniform single-table file each.
 *   sessions/{YYYY-MM}.json    — reading_sessions monthly shards.
 *
 * Why this shape: every request carries KB-sized payloads, sync work is
 * O(changed) instead of O(library × devices), and a single giant
 * JSON.stringify/parse never runs on the renderer main thread.
 *
 * Merge rules (unchanged from the snapshot engine): last-writer-wins per row
 * on the table's timestamp column, with deleted_at breaking ties; annotations
 * and messages merge per item; deletions travel as explicit tombstone maps.
 * The shared index is a union: every writer merges what it saw before
 * writing, so a racing writer can only drop its own delta for one pass.
 *
 * Backward compatibility: intentionally none for cloud sync — devices on the
 * old engine keep using per-device snapshots among themselves; a device
 * switched to this engine starts from an empty remote layout and re-pushes
 * the full library once. LAN sync keeps the old snapshot protocol and is
 * unaffected.
